  Data Removal Bot - Information & Instructions
======================================================

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**
This is a free, open-source tool provided for personal use. It comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. The success of your data removal requests is NOT
guaranteed and depends entirely on each company's internal policies and their
interpretation of laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The user is solely responsible
for the information they provide and for their use of this program. Your personal
data and email credentials are only used during the program's
execution and are NEVER stored or sent anywhere else.


WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES
----------------------
This program helps automate the process of sending data removal requests to
various public information websites across different countries. It uses your
"right to be forgotten" under regulations like GDPR as its basis.


HOW IT WORKS
------------
The script will guide you through a few steps:
1.  **Enter Your Details:** You provide your name and then specific identifiers
    (like a Swedish SSN) for each country you want to target.
2.  **Enter Email Details:** You provide your email login (using a secure App
    Password) so the script can send emails on your behalf.
3.  **Process Targets:** The script reads the `targets.json` file and performs one
    of three actions for each company:
    - **Email:** Automatically sends a personalized request from your email account.
    - **Webform:** Automatically opens Google Chrome, fills in the removal form
      with your details. You may need to solve a CAPTCHA and click "Send".
    - **Manual eID:** Provides you with a direct link and instructs you to complete
      the process manually (e.g., for Swedish BankID), as it cannot be safely automated.


======================================================
  SETUP - What to do before you run the program
======================================================

1.  **Install Python:**
    If you don't have it, download and install Python 3 from python.org.
    Make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2.  **Install Google Chrome:**
    This program uses Google Chrome to fill out forms. Please ensure it is installed.

3.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    - Open your command line tool (Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell).
    - Navigate to this project folder.
    - (Recommended) Use a virtual environment:
      On macOS/Linux: `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`
      On Windows:     `py -m venv venv` and `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      (Note: This uses Selenium's built-in driver management, so no separate
      browser driver installation is needed as long as you have Chrome installed.)


======================================================
  HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
======================================================

1.  Open your command line tool and navigate to this project folder.
2.  (If using a venv) Activate it.
3.  Run the program: `python main.py`
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts.

**ADVANCED RUN OPTIONS (FILTERING):**
You can filter which targets to run using command-line arguments.

- **Filter by Country:** Run only targets for a specific country.
  `python main.py --country SE`
  `python main.py -c US`

- **Filter by Type:** Run only targets of a specific type.
  `python main.py --type email`
  `python main.py -t webform`

- **Filter by Name:** Run only targets whose name contains a specific string.
  `python main.py --target-name "Eniro"`
  `python main.py -n "whitepages"`

You can combine flags: `python main.py -c SE -t email`


======================================================
  !!! VERY IMPORTANT: EMAIL SECURITY (GMAIL / OUTLOOK) !!!
======================================================

For security reasons, email providers like Gmail and Outlook will BLOCK login attempts
from programs like this if you use your normal password.

To make it work, you MUST generate and use an "App Password".

How to get a Gmail App Password:
--------------------------------
1.  Go to your Google Account settings -> "Security".
2.  Turn ON "2-Step Verification". This is mandatory.
3.  Click on "App passwords".
4.  Select "Mail" for the app and "Other (Custom name)" for the device.
5.  Click "Generate". Google will give you a 16-character password.

==> Use THIS 16-character password in the program. <==

How to get an Outlook/Microsoft App Password:
--------------------------------
1. Go to your Microsoft Account settings: https://account.microsoft.com/security
2. Click on "Advanced security options".
3. If you don't have it enabled, turn ON "Two-step verification". This is mandatory.
4. Scroll down to "App passwords" and click "Create a new app password".
5. Microsoft will give you a 16-character password.

==> Use THIS 16-character password in the program. <==

======================================================
  CUSTOMIZING TARGETS (ADVANCED)
======================================================

You can edit `targets.json` to add/remove companies. Each entry needs a specific structure:

- **"country":** Two-letter country code (e.g., "SE", "US"). The script will ask for
  your info for each country found.

- **type: "email"**
  Requires `contact` (email address) and `template` (the name of the template file
  without .txt, e.g., "email_template_se").
  `{ "name": "...", "country": "SE", "type": "email", "contact": "...", "template": "..." }`

- **type: "manual_eid"**
  For processes like BankID. Requires `url`. The `notes` field is optional but recommended.
  `{ "name": "...", "country": "SE", "type": "manual_eid", "url": "...", "notes": "..." }`

- **type: "webform"**
  Requires `url` and `field_map`. `field_map` connects the data keys from the program
  (e.g., "full_name", "ssn_se", "email") to the CSS selector on the webpage.
  `{ "name": "...", "country": "SE", "type": "webform", "url": "...", "field_map": { "full_name": "#name", "ssn_se": "#pnr", "email": "#user_email" } }`
